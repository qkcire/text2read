Web Application Technologies

Web applications employ a myriad of technologies to implement their function-
ality. This chapter is a short primer on the key technologies that you are likely 
to encounter when attacking web applications. We will examine the HTTP 
protocol, the technologies commonly employed on the server and client sides, 
and the encoding schemes used to represent data in different situations. These 
technologies are in general easy to understand, and a grasp of their relevant 
features is key to performing effective attacks against web applications.

If you are already familiar with the key technologies used in web applications, 
you can skim through this chapter to conﬁ rm that it offers you nothing new. If 
you are still learning how web applications work, you should read this chapter 
before continuing to the later chapters on speciﬁ c vulnerabilities. For further 
reading on many of the areas covered, we recommend HTTP: The Deﬁ nitive
Guide by David Gourley and Brian Totty (O’Reilly, 2002), and also the website 
of the World Wide Web Consortium at www.w3.org.

The HTTP Protocol

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the core communications protocol used to 
access the World Wide Web and is used by all of today’s web applications. It is 
a simple protocol that was originally developed for retrieving static text-based 
resources. It has since been extended and leveraged in various ways to enable 
it to support the complex distributed applications that are now commonplace.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

HTTP uses a message-based model in which a client sends a request mes-
sage and the server returns a response message. The protocol is essentially 
connectionless: although HTTP uses the stateful TCP protocol as its transport 
mechanism, each exchange of request and response is an autonomous transac-
tion and may use a different TCP connection.

HTTP Requests

All HTTP messages (requests and responses) consist of one or more headers, 
each on a separate line, followed by a mandatory blank line, followed by an 
optional message body. A typical HTTP request is as follows:

GET /auth/488/YourDetails.ashx?uid=129 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/x-ms-application, image/jpeg, application/xaml+xml, 
image/gif, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, application/x-shockwave-
flash, */*
Referer: https://mdsec.net/auth/488/Home.ashx
Accept-Language: en-GB
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; 
Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 
3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; InfoPath.3; .NET4.0E; FDM; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Host: mdsec.net
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie: SessionId=5B70C71F3FD4968935CDB6682E545476

The ﬁ rst line of every HTTP request consists of three items, separated by spaces:

 n A verb indicating the HTTP method. The most commonly used method 
is GET, whose function is to retrieve a resource from the web server. GET
requests do not have a message body, so no further data follows the blank 
line after the message headers.

 n The requested URL. The URL typically functions as a name for the resource 
being requested, together with an optional query string containing param-
eters that the client is passing to that resource. The query string is indicated 
by the ? character in the URL. The example contains a single parameter 
with the name uid and the value 129.

 n The HTTP version being used. The only HTTP versions in common use 
on the Internet are 1.0 and 1.1, and most browsers use version 1.1 by 
default. There are a few differences between the speciﬁ cations of these 
two versions; however, the only difference you are likely to encounter 
when attacking web applications is that in version 1.1 the Host request 
header is mandatory.

Here are some other points of interest in the sample request:

 n The Referer header is used to indicate the URL from which the request 
originated (for example, because the user clicked a link on that page). 
Note that this header was misspelled in the original HTTP speciﬁ cation, 
and the misspelled version has been retained ever since.

 n The User-Agent header is used to provide information about the browser 
or other client software that generated the request. Note that most brows-
ers include the Mozilla preﬁ x for historical reasons. This was the User-
Agent string used by the originally dominant Netscape browser, and other 
browsers wanted to assert to websites that they were compatible with this 
standard. As with many quirks from computing history, it has become so 
established that it is still retained, even on the current version of Internet 
Explorer, which made the request shown in the example.

 n The Host header speciﬁ es the hostname that appeared in the full URL 
being accessed. This is necessary when multiple websites are hosted on 
the same server, because the URL sent in the ﬁ rst line of the request usu-
ally does not contain a hostname. (See Chapter 17 for more information 
about virtually hosted websites.)

 n The Cookie header is used to submit additional parameters that the server 
has issued to the client (described in more detail later in this chapter).

HTTP Responses

A typical HTTP response is as follows:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Apr 2011 09:23:32 GMT
Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Set-Cookie: tracking=tI8rk7joMx44S2Uu85nSWc
X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

The ﬁ rst line of every HTTP response consists of three items, separated by 

spaces:

 n The HTTP version being used.

 n A numeric status code indicating the result of the request. 200 is the most 
common status code; it means that the request was successful and that 
the requested resource is being returned.

 n A textual “reason phrase” further describing the status of the response. This 
can have any value and is not used for any purpose by current browsers.

Here are some other points of interest in the response:

 n The Server header contains a banner indicating the web server software 
being used, and sometimes other details such as installed modules and 
the server operating system. The information contained may or may not 
be accurate.

 n The Set-Cookie header issues the browser a further cookie; this is sub-
mitted back in the Cookie header of subsequent requests to this server.

 n The Pragma header instructs the browser not to store the response in its 
cache. The Expires header indicates that the response content expired 
in the past and therefore should not be cached. These instructions are 
frequently issued when dynamic content is being returned to ensure 
that browsers obtain a fresh version of this content on subsequent 
occasions.

 n Almost all HTTP responses contain a message body following the blank 
line after the headers. The Content-Type header indicates that the body 
of this message contains an HTML document.

 n The Content-Length header indicates the length of the message body in 

bytes.

HTTP Methods

When you are attacking web applications, you will be dealing almost exclusively 
with the most commonly used methods: GET and POST. You need to be aware 
of some important differences between these methods, as they can affect an 
application’s security if overlooked.

The GET method is designed to retrieve resources. It can be used to send 
parameters to the requested resource in the URL query string. This enables 
users to bookmark a URL for a dynamic resource that they can reuse. Or other 
users can retrieve the equivalent resource on a subsequent occasion (as in a 
bookmarked search query). URLs are displayed on-screen and are logged in 
various places, such as the browser history and the web server’s access logs. 
They are also transmitted in the Referer header to other sites when external

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies 

43

links are followed. For these reasons, the query string should not be used to 
transmit any sensitive information.

The POST method is designed to perform actions. With this method, request 
parameters can be sent both in the URL query string and in the body of the 
message. Although the URL can still be bookmarked, any parameters sent in 
the message body will be excluded from the bookmark. These parameters will 
also be excluded from the various locations in which logs of URLs are main-
tained and from the Referer header. Because the POST method is designed for 
performing actions, if a user clicks the browser’s Back button to return to a 
page that was accessed using this method, the browser does not automatically 
reissue the request. Instead, it warns the user of what it is about to do, as shown 
in Figure 3-1. This prevents users from unwittingly performing an action more 
than once. For this reason, POST requests should always be used when an action 
is being performed.

Figure 3-1:  Browsers do not automatically reissue POST requests made by 
users, because these might cause an action to be performed more than once

In addition to the GET and POST methods, the HTTP protocol supports numer-
ous other methods that have been created for speciﬁ c purposes. Here are the 
other ones you are most likely to require knowledge of:

 n HEAD functions in the same way as a GET request, except that the server 
should not return a message body in its response. The server should return 
the same headers that it would have returned to the corresponding GET
request. Hence, this method can be used to check whether a resource is 
present before making a GET request for it.

 n TRACE is designed for diagnostic purposes. The server should return in the 
response body the exact contents of the request message it received. This 
can be used to detect the effect of any proxy servers between the client 
and server that may manipulate the request.

 n OPTIONS asks the server to report the HTTP methods that are available for 
a particular resource. The server typically returns a response containing 
an Allow header that lists the available methods.

 n PUT attempts to upload the speciﬁ ed resource to the server, using the con-
tent contained in the body of the request. If this method is enabled, you 
may be able to leverage it to attack the application, such as by uploading 
an arbitrary script and executing it on the server.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

Many other HTTP methods exist that are not directly relevant to attacking 
web applications. However, a web server may expose itself to attack if certain 
dangerous methods are available. See Chapter 18 for further details on these 
methods and examples of using them in an attack.

URLs

A uniform resource locator (URL) is a unique identiﬁ er for a web resource through 
which that resource can be retrieved. The format of most URLs is as follows:

protocol://hostname[:port]/[path/]file[?param=value]

Several components in this scheme are optional. The port number usually is 
included only if it differs from the default used by the relevant protocol. The 
URL used to generate the HTTP request shown earlier is as follows:

https://mdsec.net/auth/488/YourDetails.ashx?uid=129

In addition to this absolute form, URLs may be speciﬁ ed relative to a particular 

host, or relative to a particular path on that host. For example:

/auth/488/YourDetails.ashx?uid=129
YourDetails.ashx?uid=129

These relative forms are often used in web pages to describe navigation within 

the website or application itself.

NO TE You may encounter the term URI (or uniform resource identiﬁ er) 
being used instead of URL, but it is really only used in formal speciﬁ cations 
and by those who want to exhibit their pedantry.

REST

Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of architecture for distributed 
systems in which requests and responses contain representations of the current 
state of the system’s resources. The core technologies employed in the World 
Wide Web, including the HTTP protocol and the format of URLs, conform to 
the REST architectural style.

Although URLs containing parameters within the query string do themselves 
conform to REST constraints, the term “REST-style URL” is often used to signify 
a URL that contains its parameters within the URL ﬁ le path, rather than the 
query string. For example, the following URL containing a query string:

http://wahh-app.com/search?make=ford&model=pinto

corresponds to the following URL containing “REST-style” parameters:

http://wahh-app.com/search/ford/pinto

Chapter 4 describes how you need to consider these different parameter styles 
when mapping an application’s content and functionality and identifying its 
key attack surface.

HTTP Headers

HTTP supports a large number of headers, some of which are designed for 
speciﬁ c unusual purposes. Some headers can be used for both requests and 
responses, and others are speciﬁ c to one of these message types. The following 
sections describe the headers you are likely to encounter when attacking web 
applications.

General Headers

 n Connection tells the other end of the communication whether it should 
close the TCP connection after the HTTP transmission has completed or 
keep it open for further messages.

 n Content-Encoding speciﬁ es what kind of encoding is being used for the 
content contained in the message body, such as gzip, which is used by 
some applications to compress responses for faster transmission.

 n Content-Length speciﬁ es the length of the message body, in bytes (except 
in the case of responses to HEAD requests, when it indicates the length of 
the body in the response to the corresponding GET request).

 n Content-Type speciﬁ es the type of content contained in the message body, 

such as text/html for HTML documents.

 n Transfer-Encoding speciﬁ es any encoding that was performed on the 
message body to facilitate its transfer over HTTP. It is normally used to 
specify chunked encoding when this is employed.

Request Headers

 n Accept tells the server what kinds of content the client is willing to accept, 

such as image types, ofﬁ ce document formats, and so on.

 n Accept-Encoding tells the server what kinds of content encoding the  client 

 n Authorization submits credentials to the server for one of the built-in 

is willing to accept.

HTTP authentication types.

 n Cookie submits cookies to the server that the server previously issued.

 n Host speciﬁ es the hostname that appeared in the full URL being requested.

46 

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

 n If-Modified-Since speciﬁ es when the browser last received the requested 
resource. If the resource has not changed since that time, the server may 
instruct the client to use its cached copy, using a response with status code 304.

 n If-None-Match speciﬁ es an entity tag, which is an identiﬁ er denoting the 
contents of the message body. The browser submits the entity tag that 
the server issued with the requested resource when it was last received. 
The server can use the entity tag to determine whether the browser may 
use its cached copy of the resource.

 n Origin is used in cross-domain Ajax requests to indicate the domain from 

which the request originated (see Chapter 13).

 n Referer speciﬁ es the URL from which the current request originated.

 n User-Agent provides information about the browser or other client soft-

ware that generated the request.

Response Headers

 n Access-Control-Allow-Origin indicates whether the resource can be 

retrieved via cross-domain Ajax requests (see Chapter 13).

 n Cache-Control passes caching directives to the browser (for example, 

no-cache).

 n ETag speciﬁ es an entity tag. Clients can submit this identiﬁ er in future 
requests for the same resource in the If-None-Match header to notify the 
server which version of the resource the browser currently holds in its cache.

 n Expires tells the browser for how long the contents of the message body 
are valid. The browser may use the cached copy of this resource until 
this time.

 n Location is used in redirection responses (those that have a status code 

starting with 3) to specify the target of the redirect.

 n Pragma passes caching directives to the browser (for example, no-cache).

 n Server provides information about the web server software being used.

 n Set-Cookie issues cookies to the browser that it will submit back to the 

server in subsequent requests.

 n WWW-Authenticate is used in responses that have a 401 status code to 
provide details on the type(s) of authentication that the server supports.

 n X-Frame-Options indicates whether and how the current response may 

be loaded within a browser frame (see Chapter 13).

Cookies

Cookies are a key part of the HTTP protocol that most web applications rely 
on. Frequently they can be used as a vehicle for exploiting vulnerabilities. The 
cookie mechanism enables the server to send items of data to the client, which 
the client stores and resubmits to the server. Unlike the other types of request 
parameters (those within the URL query string or the message body), cookies 
continue to be resubmitted in each subsequent request without any particular 
action required by the application or the user.

A server issues a cookie using the Set-Cookie response header, as you 

have seen:

Set-Cookie: tracking=tI8rk7joMx44S2Uu85nSWc

The user’s browser then automatically adds the following header to subsequent 
requests back to the same server:

Cookie: tracking=tI8rk7joMx44S2Uu85nSWc

Cookies normally consist of a name/value pair, as shown, but they may consist 
of any string that does not contain a space. Multiple cookies can be issued by 
using multiple Set-Cookie headers in the server’s response. These are submit-
ted back to the server in the same Cookie header, with a semicolon separating 
different individual cookies.

In addition to the cookie’s actual value, the Set-Cookie header can include 
any of the following optional attributes, which can be used to control how the 
browser handles the cookie:

 n expires sets a date until which the cookie is valid. This causes the browser 
to save the cookie to persistent storage, and it is reused in subsequent 
browser sessions until the expiration date is reached. If this attribute is 
not set, the cookie is used only in the current browser session.

 n domain speciﬁ es the domain for which the cookie is valid. This must be 
the same or a parent of the domain from which the cookie is received.

 n path speciﬁ es the URL path for which the cookie is valid.

 n secure — If this attribute is set, the cookie will be submitted only in HTTPS 

 n HttpOnly — If this attribute is set, the cookie cannot be directly accessed 

requests.

via client-side JavaScript.

Each of these cookie attributes can impact the application’s security. The 
primary impact is on the attacker’s ability to directly target other users of the 
application. See Chapters 12 and 13 for more details.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

Status Codes

Each HTTP response message must contain a status code in its ﬁ rst line, indi-
cating the result of the request. The status codes fall into ﬁ ve groups, according 
to the code’s ﬁ rst digit:

 n 1xx — Informational.

 n 2xx — The request was successful.

 n 3xx — The client is redirected to a different resource.

 n 4xx — The request contains an error of some kind.

 n 5xx — The server encountered an error fulﬁ lling the request.

There are numerous speciﬁ c status codes, many of which are used only in 
specialized circumstances. Here are the status codes you are most likely to 
encounter when attacking a web application, along with the usual reason phrase 
associated with them:

 n 100 Continue is sent in some circumstances when a client submits a 
request containing a body. The response indicates that the request headers 
were received and that the client should continue sending the body. The 
server returns a second response when the request has been completed.

 n 200 OK indicates that the request was successful and that the response 

body contains the result of the request.

 n 201 Created is returned in response to a PUT request to indicate that the 

request was successful.

 n 301 Moved Permanently redirects the browser permanently to a different 
URL, which is speciﬁ ed in the Location header. The client should use the 
new URL in the future rather than the original.

 n 302 Found redirects the browser temporarily to a different URL, which is 
speciﬁ ed in the Location header. The client should revert to the original 
URL in subsequent requests.

 n 304 Not Modified instructs the browser to use its cached copy of the 
requested resource. The server uses the If-Modified-Since and If-None-
Match request headers to determine whether the client has the latest  version 
of the resource.

 n 400 Bad Request indicates that the client submitted an invalid HTTP request. 
You will probably encounter this when you have modiﬁ ed a request in 
certain invalid ways, such as by placing a space character into the URL.

 n 401 Unauthorized indicates that the server requires HTTP authentication 
before the request will be granted. The WWW-Authenticate header contains 
details on the type(s) of authentication supported.

49

 n 403 Forbidden indicates that no one is allowed to access the requested 

resource, regardless of authentication.

 n 404 Not Found indicates that the requested resource does not exist.

 n 405 Method Not Allowed indicates that the method used in the request is 
not supported for the speciﬁ ed URL. For example, you may receive this 
status code if you attempt to use the PUT method where it is not supported.

 n 413 Request Entity Too Large — If you are probing for buffer overﬂ ow 
vulnerabilities in native code, and therefore are submitting long strings 
of data, this indicates that the body of your request is too large for the 
server to handle.

 n 414 Request URI Too Long is similar to the 413 response. It indicates that 

the URL used in the request is too large for the server to handle.

 n 500 Internal Server Error indicates that the server encountered an 
error fulﬁ lling the request. This normally occurs when you have submit-
ted unexpected input that caused an unhandled error somewhere within 
the application’s processing. You should closely review the full contents 
of the server’s response for any details indicating the nature of the error.

 n 503 Service Unavailable normally indicates that, although the web 
server itself is functioning and can respond to requests, the application 
accessed via the server is not responding. You should verify whether this 
is the result of any action you have performed.

HTTPS

The HTTP protocol uses plain TCP as its transport mechanism, which is unen-
crypted and therefore can be intercepted by an attacker who is suitably posi-
tioned on the network. HTTPS is essentially the same application-layer protocol 
as HTTP but is tunneled over the secure transport mechanism, Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL). This protects the privacy and integrity of data passing over the 
network, reducing the possibilities for noninvasive interception attacks. HTTP 
requests and responses function in exactly the same way regardless of whether 
SSL is used for transport.

NO TE SSL has strictly been superseded by transport layer security (TLS), but 
the latter usually still is referred to using the older name.

HTTP Proxies

An HTTP proxy is a server that mediates access between the client browser and 
the destination web server. When a browser has been conﬁ gured to use a proxy

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

server, it makes all its requests to that server. The proxy relays the requests to 
the relevant web servers and forwards their responses back to the browser. 
Most proxies also provide additional services, including caching, authentica-
tion, and access control.

You should be aware of two differences in how HTTP works when a proxy 

server is being used:

 n When a browser issues an unencrypted HTTP request to a proxy server, it 
places the full URL into the request, including the protocol preﬁ x http://,
the server’s hostname, and the port number if this is nonstandard. The 
proxy server extracts the hostname and port and uses these to direct the 
request to the correct destination web server.

 n When HTTPS is being used, the browser cannot perform the SSL hand-
shake with the proxy server, because this would break the secure tunnel 
and leave the communications vulnerable to interception attacks. Hence, 
the browser must use the proxy as a pure TCP-level relay, which passes 
all network data in both directions between the browser and the destina-
tion web server, with which the browser performs an SSL handshake as 
normal. To establish this relay, the browser makes an HTTP request to the 
proxy server using the CONNECT method and specifying the destination 
hostname and port number as the URL. If the proxy allows the request, 
it returns an HTTP response with a 200 status, keeps the TCP connection 
open, and from that point onward acts as a pure TCP-level relay to the 
destination web server.

By some measure, the most useful item in your toolkit when attacking web 
applications is a specialized kind of proxy server that sits between your browser 
and the target website and allows you to intercept and modify all requests and 
responses, even those using HTTPS. We will begin examining how you can use 
this kind of tool in the next chapter.

HTTP Authentication

The HTTP protocol includes its own mechanisms for authenticating users using 
various authentication schemes, including the following:

 n Basic is a simple authentication mechanism that sends user credentials as 

a Base64-encoded string in a request header with each message.

 n NTLM is a challenge-response mechanism and uses a version of the 

Windows NTLM protocol.

 n Digest is a challenge-response mechanism and uses MD5 checksums of 

a nonce with the user’s credentials.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies 

51

It is relatively rare to encounter these authentication protocols being used 
by web applications deployed on the Internet. They are more commonly used 
within organizations to access intranet-based services.

COMMON MYTH

“Basic authentication is insecure.”

Because basic authentication places credentials in unencrypted form within 

the HTTP request, it is frequently stated that the protocol is insecure and 
should not be used. But forms-based authentication, as used by numerous 
banks, also places credentials in unencrypted form within the HTTP request.

Any HTTP message can be protected from eavesdropping attacks by using HTTPS 

as a transport mechanism, which should be done by every security-conscious 
application. In relation to eavesdropping, at least, basic authentication in itself 
is no worse than the methods used by the majority of today’s web applications.

Web Functionality

In addition to the core communications protocol used to send messages between 
client and server, web applications employ numerous technologies to deliver 
their functionality. Any reasonably functional application may employ dozens 
of distinct technologies within its server and client components. Before you can 
mount a serious attack against a web application, you need a basic understand-
ing of how its functionality is implemented, how the technologies used are 
designed to behave, and where their weak points are likely to lie.

Server-Side Functionality

The early World Wide Web contained entirely static content. Websites con-
sisted of various resources such as HTML pages and images, which were 
simply loaded onto a web server and delivered to any user who requested 
them. Each time a particular resource was requested, the server responded 
with the same content.

Today’s web applications still typically employ a fair number of static resources. 
However, a large amount of the content that they present to users is generated 
dynamically. When a user requests a dynamic resource, the server’s response 
is created on the ﬂ y, and each user may receive content that is uniquely custom-
ized for him or her.

Dynamic content is generated by scripts or other code executing on the server. 
These scripts are akin to computer programs in their own right. They have vari-
ous inputs, perform processing on these, and return their outputs to the user.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

When a user’s browser requests a dynamic resource, normally it does not 
simply ask for a copy of that resource. In general, it also submits various 
parameters along with its request. It is these parameters that enable the server-
side application to generate content that is tailored to the individual user. 
HTTP requests can be used to send parameters to the application in three 
main ways:

 n In the URL query string

 n In the ﬁ le path of REST-style URLs

 n In HTTP cookies

 n In the body of requests using the POST method

In addition to these primary sources of input, the server-side application may 
in principle use any part of the HTTP request as an input to its processing. For 
example, an application may process the User-Agent header to generate content 
that is optimized for the type of browser being used.

Like computer software in general, web applications employ a wide range of 

technologies on the server side to deliver their functionality:

 n Scripting languages such as PHP, VBScript, and Perl

 n Web application platforms such as ASP.NET and Java

 n Web servers such as Apache, IIS, and Netscape Enterprise

 n Databases such as MS-SQL, Oracle, and MySQL

 n Other back-end components such as ﬁ lesystems, SOAP-based web services, 

and directory services

All these technologies and the types of vulnerabilities that can arise in rela-
tion to them are examined in detail throughout this book. Some of the most 
common web application platforms and technologies you are likely to encounter 
are described in the following sections.

COMMON MYTH

“Our applications need only cursory security review, because they employ a 
well-used framework.”

Use of a well-used framework is often a cause for complacency in web 
application development, on the assumption that common vulnerabilities 
such as SQL injection are automatically avoided. This assumption is mistaken 
for two reasons.

First, a large number of web application vulnerabilities arise in an applica-
tion’s design, not its implementation, and are independent of the development 
framework or language chosen.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies 

53

Second, because a framework typically employs plug-ins and packages 

from the cutting edge of the latest repositories, it is likely that these packages 
have not undergone security review. Interestingly, if a vulnerability is later 
found in the application, the same proponents of the myth will readily swap 
sides and blame their framework or third-party package!

The Java Platform

For many years, the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (formerly known as J2EE) 
was a de facto standard for large-scale enterprise applications. Originally devel-
oped by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle, it lends itself to multitiered 
and load-balanced architectures and is well suited to modular development and 
code reuse. Because of its long history and widespread adoption, many high-
quality development tools, application servers, and frameworks are available to 
assist developers. The Java Platform can be run on several underlying operating 
systems, including Windows, Linux, and Solaris.

Descriptions of Java-based web applications often employ a number of poten-

tially confusing terms that you may need to be aware of:

 n An Enterprise Java Bean (EJB) is a relatively heavyweight software com-
ponent that encapsulates the logic of a speciﬁ c business function within the 
application. EJBs are intended to take care of various technical challenges 
that application developers must address, such as transactional integrity.

 n A Plain Old Java Object (POJO) is an ordinary Java object, as distinct 
from a special object such as an EJB. A POJO normally is used to denote 
objects that are user-deﬁ ned and are much simpler and more lightweight 
than EJBs and those used in other frameworks.

 n A Java Servlet is an object that resides on an application server and receives 
HTTP requests from clients and returns HTTP responses. Servlet imple-
mentations can use numerous interfaces to facilitate the development of 
useful applications.

 n A Java web container is a platform or engine that provides a runtime 
environment for Java-based web applications. Examples of Java web con-
tainers are Apache Tomcat, BEA WebLogic, and JBoss.

Many Java web applications employ third-party and open source components 
alongside custom-built code. This is an attractive option because it reduces 
development effort, and Java is well suited to this modular approach. Here are 
some examples of components commonly used for key application functions:

 n Authentication — JAAS, ACEGI

 n Presentation layer — SiteMesh, Tapestry

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

 n Database object relational mapping — Hibernate

 n Logging — Log4J

If you can determine which open source packages are used in the application 
you are attacking, you can download these and perform a code review or install 
them to experiment on. A vulnerability in any of these may be exploitable to 
compromise the wider application.

ASP.NET

ASP.NET is Microsoft’s web application framework and is a direct competitor 
to the Java Platform. ASP.NET is several years younger than its counterpart but 
has made signiﬁ cant inroads into Java’s territory.

ASP.NET uses Microsoft’s .NET Framework, which provides a virtual machine 
(the Common Language Runtime) and a set of powerful APIs. Hence, ASP.NET 
applications can be written in any .NET language, such as C# or VB.NET.

ASP.NET lends itself to the event-driven programming paradigm that is 
normally used in conventional desktop software, rather than the script-based 
approach used in most earlier web application frameworks. This, together with 
the powerful development tools provided with Visual Studio, makes devel-
oping a functional web application extremely easy for anyone with minimal 
programming skills.

The ASP.NET framework helps protect against some common web application 
vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, without requiring any effort from 
the developer. However, one practical downside of its apparent simplicity is that 
many small-scale ASP.NET applications are actually created by beginners who 
lack any awareness of the core security problems faced by web applications.

PHP

The PHP language emerged from a hobby project (the acronym originally stood 
for “personal home page”). It has since evolved almost unrecognizably into 
a highly powerful and rich framework for developing web applications. It is 
often used in conjunction with other free technologies in what is known as the 
LAMP stack (composed of Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web 
server, MySQL as the database server, and PHP as the programming language 
for the web application).

Numerous open source applications and components have been developed 
using PHP. Many of these provide off-the-shelf solutions for common application 
functions, which are often incorporated into wider custom-built applications:

 n Bulletin boards — PHPBB, PHP-Nuke

 n Administrative front ends — PHPMyAdmin

 n Web mail — SquirrelMail, IlohaMail

 n Photo galleries — Gallery

 n Shopping carts — osCommerce, ECW-Shop

 n Wikis — MediaWiki, WakkaWikki

Because PHP is free and easy to use, it has often been the language of choice 
for many beginners writing web applications. Furthermore, the design and 
default conﬁ guration of the PHP framework has historically made it easy for 
programmers to unwittingly introduce security bugs into their code. These 
factors have meant that applications written in PHP have suffered from a dis-
proportionate number of security vulnerabilities. In addition, several defects 
have existed within the PHP platform itself that often could be exploited via 
applications running on it. See Chapter 19 for details on common defects aris-
ing in PHP applications.

Ruby on Rails

Rails 1.0 was released in 2005, with strong emphasis on Model-View-Controller 
architecture. A key strength of Rails is the breakneck speed with which 
fully ﬂ edged data-driven applications can be created. If a developer follows the 
Rails coding style and naming conventions, Rails can autogenerate a model 
for database content, controller actions for modifying it, and default views for 
the application user. As with any highly functional new technology, several 
 vulnerabilities have been found in Ruby on Rails, including the ability to bypass 
a “safe mode,” analogous to that found in PHP.

More details on recent vulnerabilities can be found here:

www.ruby-lang.org/en/security/

SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to access data in relational databases, 
such as Oracle, MS-SQL server and MySQL. The vast majority of today’s web 
applications employ SQL-based databases as their back-end data store, and nearly 
all application functions involve interaction with these data stores in some way.
Relational databases store data in tables, each of which contains a number 
of rows and columns. Each column represents a data ﬁ eld, such as “name” or 
“e-mail address,” and each row represents an item with values assigned to some 
or all of these ﬁ elds.

SQL uses queries to perform common tasks such as reading, adding, updat-
ing, and deleting data. For example, to retrieve a user’s e-mail address with a 
speciﬁ ed name, an application might perform the following query:

select email from users where name = ‘daf’

56 

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

To implement the functionality they need, web applications may incorporate 
user-supplied input into SQL queries that are executed by the back-end data-
base. If this process is not carried out safely, attackers may be able to submit 
malicious input to interfere with the database and potentially read and write 
sensitive data. These attacks are described in Chapter 9, along with detailed 
explanations of the SQL language and how it can be used.

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a speciﬁ cation for encoding data in a 
machine-readable form. Like any markup language, the XML format sepa-
rates a document into content (which is data) and markup (which annotates 
the data).

Markup is primarily represented using tags, which may be start tags, end 

tags, or empty-element tags:

XML

<tagname>
</tagname>
<tagname />

Start and end tags are paired into elements and may encapsulate document 

content or child elements:

<pet>ginger</pet>
<pets><dog>spot</dog><cat>paws</cat></pets>

Tags may include attributes, which are name/value pairs:

<data version=”2.1”><pets>...</pets></data>

XML is extensible in that it allows arbitrary tag and attribute names. XML 
documents often include a Document Type Deﬁ nition (DTD), which deﬁ nes 
the tags and attributes used in the documents and the ways in which they can 
be combined.

XML and technologies derived from it are used extensively in web applica-
tions, on both the server and client side, as described in later sections of this 
chapter.

Web Services

Although this book covers web application hacking, many of the vulnerabilities 
described are equally applicable to web services. In fact, many applications are 
essentially a GUI front-end to a set of back-end web services.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies 

57

Web services use Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to exchange data. 
SOAP typically uses the HTTP protocol to transmit messages and represents 
data using the XML format.

A typical SOAP request is as follows:

POST /doTransfer.asp HTTP/1.0
Host: mdsec-mgr.int.mdsec.net
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 891
<?xml version=”1.0”?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=”http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope”>
  <soap:Body>
      <pre:Add xmlns:pre=http://target/lists soap:encodingStyle=
“http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding”>
      <Account>
        <FromAccount>18281008</FromAccount>
        <Amount>1430</Amount>
        <ClearedFunds>False</ClearedFunds>
        <ToAccount>08447656</ToAccount>
      </Account>
    </pre:Add>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

In the context of web applications accessed using a browser, you are most 
likely to encounter SOAP being used by the server-side application to com-
municate with various back-end systems. If user-supplied data is incorporated 
directly into back-end SOAP messages, similar vulnerabilities can arise as for 
SQL. These issues are described in detail in Chapter 10.

If a web application also exposes web services directly, these are also worthy 
of examination. Even if the front-end application is simply written on top of the 
web service, differences may exist in input handling and in the functionality 
exposed by the services themselves. The server normally publishes the available 
services and parameters using the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 
format. Tools such as soapUI can be used to create sample requests based on a 
published WSDL ﬁ le to call the authentication web service, gain an authentica-
tion token, and make any subsequent web service requests.

Client-Side Functionality

For the server-side application to receive user input and actions and present 
the results to the user, it needs to provide a client-side user interface. Because 
all web applications are accessed via a web browser, these interfaces all share a

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

common core of technologies. However, these have been built upon in various, 
diverse ways, and the ways in which applications leverage client-side technol-
ogy has continued to evolve rapidly in recent years.

HTML

The core technology used to build web interfaces is hypertext markup language 
(HTML). Like XML, HTML is a tag-based language that is used to describe the 
structure of documents that are rendered within the browser. From its simple 
beginnings as a means of providing basic formatting for text documents, HTML 
has developed into a rich and powerful language that can be used to create 
highly complex and functional user interfaces.

XHTML is a development of HTML that is based on XML and that has a stricter 
speciﬁ cation than older versions of HTML. Part of the motivation for XHTML 
was the need to move toward a more rigid standard for HTML markup to avoid 
the various compromises and security issues that can arise when browsers are 
obligated to tolerate less-strict forms of HTML.

More details about HTML and related technologies appear in the following 

sections.

Hyperlinks

A large amount of communication from client to server is driven by the user’s 
clicking on hyperlinks. In web applications, hyperlinks frequently contain preset 
request parameters. These are items of data that the user never enters; they are 
submitted because the server places them into the target URL of the hyperlink 
that the user clicks. For example, a web application might present a series of 
links to news stories, each having the following form:

<!-- <a href=”?redir=/updates/update29.html”>What’s happening?</a> -->

When a user clicks this link, the browser makes the following request:

GET /news/8/?redir=/updates/update29.html HTTP/1.1
Host: mdsec.net
...

The server receives the redir parameter in the query string and uses its value 
to determine what content should be presented to the user.

Forms

Although hyperlink-based navigation is responsible for a large amount of client-
to-server communications, most web applications need more ﬂ exible ways 
to gather input and receive actions from users. HTML forms are the usual 

c03.indd   58

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies 

59

mechanism for allowing users to enter arbitrary input via their browser. A 
typical form is as follows:

<form action=”/secure/login.php?app=quotations” method=”post”>
username: <input type=”text” name=”username”><br>
password: <input type=”password” name=”password”>
<input type=”hidden” name=”redir” value=”/secure/home.php”>
<input type=”submit” name=”submit” value=”log in”>
</form>

When the user enters values into the form and clicks the Submit button, the 
browser makes a request like the following:

POST /secure/login.php?app=quotations HTTP/1.1
Host: wahh-app.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 39
Cookie: SESS=GTnrpx2ss2tSWSnhXJGyG0LJ47MXRsjcFM6Bd

username=daf&password=foo&redir=/secure/home.php&submit=log+in

In this request, several points of interest reﬂ ect how different aspects of the 
request are used to control server-side processing:

 n Because the HTML form tag contains an attribute specifying the POST
method, the browser uses this method to submit the form and places the 
data from the form into the body of the request message.

 n In addition to the two items of data that the user enters, the form contains 
a hidden parameter (redir) and a submit parameter (submit). Both of 
these are submitted in the request and may be used by the server-side 
application to control its logic.

 n The target URL for the form submission contains a preset parameter (app),
as in the hyperlink example shown previously. This parameter may be 
used to control the server-side processing.

 n The request contains a cookie parameter (SESS), which was issued to the 
browser in an earlier response from the server. This parameter may be 
used to control the server-side processing.

The preceding request contains a header specifying that the type of content in 
the message body is x-www-form-urlencoded. This means that parameters are 
represented in the message body as name/value pairs in the same way as they 
are in the URL query string. The other content type you are likely to encoun-
ter when form data is submitted is multipart/form-data. An application can 
request that browsers use multipart encoding by specifying this in an enctype
attribute in the form tag. With this form of encoding, the Content-Type header 
in the request also speciﬁ es a random string that is used as a separator for the

parameters contained in the request body. For example, if the form speciﬁ ed 
multipart encoding, the resulting request would look like the following:

Host: wahh-app.com
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=------------7d71385d0a1a

CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to describe the presentation of a 
document written in a markup language. Within web applications, it is used to 
specify how HTML content should be rendered on-screen (and in other media, 
such as the printed page).

Modern web standards aim to separate as much as possible the content of a 
document from its presentation. This separation has numerous beneﬁ ts, includ-
ing simpler and smaller HTML pages, easier updating of formatting across a 
website, and improved accessibility.

CSS is based on formatting rules that can be deﬁ ned with different levels 
of speciﬁ city. Where multiple rules match an individual document element, 
different attributes deﬁ ned in those rules can “cascade” through these rules so 
that the appropriate combination of style attributes is applied to the element.
CSS syntax uses selectors to deﬁ ne a class of markup elements to which 
a given set of attributes should be applied. For example, the following 
CSS rule deﬁ nes the foreground color for headings that are marked up using 
<h2> tags:

h2 { color: red; }

61

In the earliest days of web application security, CSS was largely overlooked 
and was considered to have no security implications. Today, CSS is increasingly 
relevant both as a source of security vulnerabilities in its own right and as a 
means of delivering effective exploits for other categories of vulnerabilities (see 
Chapters 12 and 13 for more information).

JavaScript

Hyperlinks and forms can be used to create a rich user interface that can easily 
gather most kinds of input that web applications require. However, most appli-
cations employ a more distributed model, in which the client side is used not 
simply to submit user data and actions but also to perform actual processing 
of data. This is done for two primary reasons:

 n It can improve the application’s performance, because certain tasks can 
be carried out entirely on the client component, without needing to make 
a round trip of request and response to the server.

 n It can enhance usability, because parts of the user interface can be dynami-
cally updated in response to user actions, without needing to load an 
entirely new HTML page delivered by the server.

JavaScript is a relatively simple but powerful programming language that 
can be easily used to extend web interfaces in ways that are not possible using 
HTML alone. It is commonly used to perform the following tasks:

 n Validating user-entered data before it is submitted to the server to avoid 

unnecessary requests if the data contains errors

 n Dynamically modifying the user interface in response to user actions — for 
example, to implement drop-down menus and other controls familiar 
from non-web interfaces

 n Querying and updating the document object model (DOM) within the 
browser to control the browser’s behavior (the browser DOM is described 
in a moment)

VBScript

VBScript is an alternative to JavaScript that is supported only in the Internet 
Explorer browser. It is modeled on Visual Basic and allows interaction with 
the browser DOM. But in general it is somewhat less powerful and developed 
than JavaScript.

Due to its browser-speciﬁ c nature, VBScript is scarcely used in today’s web 
applications. Its main interest from a security perspective is as a means of 
delivering exploits for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting in occasional 
situations where an exploit using JavaScript is not feasible (see Chapter 12).

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an abstract representation of an HTML 
document that can be queried and manipulated through its API.

The DOM allows client-side scripts to access individual HTML elements by 
their id and to traverse the structure of elements programmatically. Data such 
as the current URL and cookies can also be read and updated. The DOM also 
includes an event model, allowing code to hook events such as form submission, 
navigation via links, and keystrokes.

Manipulation of the browser DOM is a key technique used in Ajax-based 

applications, as described in the following section.

Ajax

Ajax is a collection of programming techniques used on the client side to create 
user interfaces that aim to mimic the smooth interaction and dynamic behavior 
of traditional desktop applications.

The name originally was an acronym for “Asynchronous JavaScript and 
XML,” although in today’s web Ajax requests need not be asynchronous and 
need not employ XML.

The earliest web applications were based on complete pages. Each user action, 
such as clicking a link or submitting a form, initiated a window-level navigation 
event, causing a new page to be loaded from the server. This approach resulted 
in a disjointed user experience, with noticeable delays while large responses 
were received from the server and the whole page was rerendered.

With Ajax, some user actions are handled within client-side script code and 
do not cause a full reload of the page. Instead, the script performs a request “in 
the background” and typically receives a much smaller response that is used to 
dynamically update only part of the user interface. For example, in an Ajax-based 
shopping application, clicking an Add to Cart button may cause a background 
request that updates the server-side record of the user’s shopping cart and a 
lightweight response that updates the number of cart items showing on the 
user’s screen. Virtually the entire existing page remains unmodiﬁ ed within the 
browser, providing a much faster and more satisfying experience for the user.
The core technology used in Ajax is XMLHttpRequest. After a certain consolida-
tion of standards, this is now a native JavaScript object that client-side scripts can 
use to make “background” requests without requiring a window-level naviga-
tion event. Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest allows arbitrary content to be sent 
in requests and received in responses. Although many Ajax applications do use 
XML to format message data, an increasing number have opted to exchange data 
using other methods of representation. (See the next section for one example.)

Note that although most Ajax applications do use asynchronous communica-
tions with the server, this is not essential. In some situations, it may actually make 

c03.indd   62

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies 

63

more sense to prevent user interaction with the application while a particular 
action is carried out. In these situations, Ajax is still beneﬁ cial in providing a 
more seamless experience by avoiding the need to reload an entire page.

Historically, the use of Ajax has introduced some new types of vulnerabili-
ties into web applications. More broadly, it also increases the attack surface of 
a typical application by introducing more potential targets for attack on both 
the server and client side. Ajax techniques are also available for use by attack-
ers when they are devising more effective exploits for other vulnerabilities. See 
Chapters 12 and 13 for more details.

JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a simple data transfer format that can 
be used to serialize arbitrary data. It can be processed directly by JavaScript 
interpreters. It is commonly employed in Ajax applications as an alternative to 
the XML format originally used for data transmission. In a typical situation, 
when a user performs an action, client-side JavaScript uses XMLHttpRequest to 
communicate the action to the server. The server returns a lightweight response 
containing data in JSON format. The client-side script then processes this data 
and updates the user interface accordingly.

For example, an Ajax-based web mail application may contain a feature to 
show the details of a selected contact. When a user clicks a contact, the browser 
uses XMLHttpRequest to retrieve the details of the selected contact, which are 
returned using JSON:

{
    “name”: “Mike Kemp”,
    “id”: “8041148671”,
    “email”: “fkwitt@layerone.com”
}

The client-side script uses the JavaScript interpreter to consume the JSON 
response and updates the relevant part of the user interface based on its contents.
A further location where you may encounter JSON data in today’s applications 
is as a means of encapsulating data within conventional request parameters. For 
example, when the user updates the details of a contact, the new information 
might be communicated to the server using the following request:

POST /contacts HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 89

Contact={“name”:”Mike Kemp”,”id”:”8041148671”,”email”:”pikey@
clappymonkey.com”}

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

Same-Origin Policy

The same-origin policy is a key mechanism implemented within browsers that 
is designed to keep content that came from different origins from interfering 
with each other. Basically, content received from one website is allowed to read 
and modify other content received from the same site but is not allowed to 
access content received from other sites.

If the same-origin policy did not exist, and an unwitting user browsed to a 
malicious website, script code running on that site could access the data and 
functionality of any other website also visited by the user. This may enable the 
malicious site to perform funds transfers from the user’s online bank, read his 
or her web mail, or capture credit card details when the user shops online. For 
this reason, browsers implement restrictions to allow this type of interaction 
only with content that has been received from the same origin.

In practice, applying this concept to the details of different web features and 
technologies leads to various complications and compromises. Here are some 
key features of the same-origin policy that you need to be aware of:

 n A page residing on one domain can cause an arbitrary request to be made 
to another domain (for example, by submitting a form or loading an 
image). But it cannot itself process the data returned from that request.

 n A page residing on one domain can load a script from another domain and 
execute this within its own context. This is because scripts are assumed 
to contain code, rather than data, so cross-domain access should not lead 
to disclosure of any sensitive information.

 n A page residing on one domain cannot read or modify the cookies or 

other DOM data belonging to another domain.

These features can lead to various cross-domain attacks, such as inducing 
user actions and capturing data. Further complications arise with browser 
extension technologies, which implement same-origin restrictions in different 
ways. These issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.

HTML5

ing reasons:

HTML5 is a major update to the HTML standard. HTML5 currently is still under 
development and is only partially implemented within browsers.

From a security perspective, HTML5 is primarily of interest for the follow-

 n It introduces various new tags, attributes, and APIs that can be lever-
aged to deliver cross-site scripting and other attacks, as described in 
Chapter 12.

 n It modiﬁ es the core Ajax technology, XMLHttpRequest, to enable two-way 
cross-domain interaction in certain situations. This can lead to new cross-
domain attacks, as described in Chapter 13.

 n It introduces new mechanisms for client-side data storage, which can lead 
to user privacy issues, and new categories of attack such as client-side SQL 
injection, as described in Chapter 13.

“Web 2.0”

This buzzword has become fashionable in recent years as a rather loose and 
nebulous name for a range of related trends in web applications, including the 
following:

 n Heavy use of Ajax for performing asynchronous, behind-the-scenes requests

 n Increased cross-domain integration using various techniques

 n Use of new technologies on the client side, including XML, JSON, and Flex

 n More prominent functionality supporting user-generated content, infor-

mation sharing, and interaction

As with all changes in technology, these trends present new opportunities 
for security vulnerabilities to arise. However, they do not deﬁ ne a clear subset 
of web application security issues in general. The vulnerabilities that occur in 
these contexts are largely the same as, or closely derived from, types of vulner-
abilities that preceded these trends. In general, talking about “Web 2.0 Security” 
usually represents a category mistake that does not facilitate clear thinking 
about the issues that matter.

Browser Extension Technologies

Going beyond the capabilities of JavaScript, some web applications employ 
browser extension technologies that use custom code to extend the browser’s 
built-in capabilities in arbitrary ways. These components may be deployed as 
bytecode that is executed by a suitable browser plug-in or may involve installing 
native executables onto the client computer itself. The thick-client technologies 
you are likely to encounter when attacking web applications are

 n Java applets

 n ActiveX controls

 n Flash objects

 n Silverlight objects

These technologies are described in detail in Chapter 5.

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

State and Sessions

The technologies described so far enable the server and client components of 
a web application to exchange and process data in numerous ways. To imple-
ment most kinds of useful functionality, however, applications need to track the 
state of each user’s interaction with the application across multiple requests. For 
example, a shopping application may allow users to browse a product catalog, 
add items to a cart, view and update the cart contents, proceed to checkout, and 
provide personal and payment details.

To make this kind of functionality possible, the application must maintain a 
set of stateful data generated by the user’s actions across several requests. This 
data normally is held within a server-side structure called a session. When a 
user performs an action, such as adding an item to her shopping cart, the server-
side application updates the relevant details within the user’s session. When the 
user later views the contents of her cart, data from the session is used to return 
the correct information to the user.

In some applications, state information is stored on the client component 
rather than the server. The current set of data is passed to the client in each 
server response and is sent back to the server in each client request. Of course, 
because the user may modify any data transmitted via the client component, 
applications need to protect themselves from attackers who may change this 
state information in an attempt to interfere with the application’s logic. The 
ASP.NET platform makes use of a hidden form ﬁ eld called ViewState to store 
state information about the user’s web interface and thereby reduce overhead 
on the server. By default, the contents of the ViewState include a keyed hash 
to prevent tampering.

Because the HTTP protocol is itself stateless, most applications need a way to 
reidentify individual users across multiple requests for the correct set of state 
data to be used to process each request. Normally this is achieved by issuing 
each user a token that uniquely identiﬁ es that user’s session. These tokens may 
be transmitted using any type of request parameter, but most applications use 
HTTP cookies. Several kinds of vulnerabilities arise in relation to session han-
dling, as described in detail in Chapter 7.

Encoding Schemes

Web applications employ several different encoding schemes for their data. Both 
the HTTP protocol and the HTML language are historically text-based, and dif-
ferent encoding schemes have been devised to ensure that these mechanisms 
can safely handle unusual characters and binary data. When you are attacking 
a web application, you will frequently need to encode data using a relevant

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

scheme to ensure that it is handled in the way you intend. Furthermore, in many 
cases you may be able to manipulate the encoding schemes an application uses 
to cause behavior that its designers did not intend.

URL Encoding

URLs are permitted to contain only the printable characters in the US-ASCII 
character set — that is, those whose ASCII code is in the range 0x20 to 0x7e, 
inclusive. Furthermore, several characters within this range are restricted because 
they have special meaning within the URL scheme itself or within the HTTP 
protocol.

The URL-encoding scheme is used to encode any problematic characters 
within the extended ASCII character set so that they can be safely transported 
over HTTP. The URL-encoded form of any character is the % preﬁ x followed by 
the character’s two-digit ASCII code expressed in hexadecimal. Here are some 
characters that are commonly URL-encoded:

 n %3d — =

 n %25 — %

 n %20 — Space

 n %0a — New line

 n %00 — Null byte

A further encoding to be aware of is the + character, which represents a 

 URL-encoded space (in addition to the %20 representation of a space).

NO TE For the purpose of attacking web applications, you should URL-
encode any of the following characters when you insert them as data into an 
HTTP request:

space % ? & = ; + #

(Of course, you will often need to use these characters with their special 
meaning when modifying a request — for example, to add a request parameter 
to the query string. In this case, they should be used in their literal form.)

Unicode Encoding

Unicode is a character encoding standard that is designed to support all of the 
world’s writing systems. It employs various encoding schemes, some of which 
can be used to represent unusual characters in web applications.

16-bit Unicode encoding works in a similar way to URL encoding. For 
transmission over HTTP, the 16-bit Unicode-encoded form of a character is

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

the %u preﬁ x followed by the character’s Unicode code point expressed in 
hexadecimal:

 n %u2215 — /

 n %u00e9 — é

 n %c2%a9 — ©

 n %e2%89%a0 — (cid:122)

UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding standard that employs one or more bytes 
to express each character. For transmission over HTTP, the UTF-8-encoded form 
of a multibyte character simply uses each byte expressed in hexadecimal and 
preceded by the % preﬁ x:

For the purpose of attacking web applications, Unicode encoding is primarily 
of interest because it can sometimes be used to defeat input validation mecha-
nisms. If an input ﬁ lter blocks certain malicious expressions, but the component 
that subsequently processes the input understands Unicode encoding, it may 
be possible to bypass the ﬁ lter using various standard and malformed Unicode 
encodings.

HTML Encoding

HTML encoding is used to represent problematic characters so that they can be 
safely incorporated into an HTML document. Various characters have special 
meaning as metacharacters within HTML and are used to deﬁ ne a document’s 
structure rather than its content. To use these characters safely as part of the 
document’s content, it is necessary to HTML-encode them.

HTML encoding deﬁ nes numerous HTML entities to represent speciﬁ c literal 

characters:

 n &quot; — "

 n &apos; — '

 n &amp; — &

 n &lt; — <

 n &gt; — >

 n &#34; — "

 n &#39; — '

In addition, any character can be HTML-encoded using its ASCII code in deci-
mal form:

or by using its ASCII code in hexadecimal form (preﬁ xed by an x):

69

 n &#x22; — "

 n &#x27; — '

When you are attacking a web application, your main interest in HTML 
encoding is likely to be when probing for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. If 
an application returns user input unmodiﬁ ed within its responses, it is prob-
ably vulnerable, whereas if dangerous characters are HTML-encoded, it may 
be safe. See Chapter 12 for more details on these vulnerabilities.

Base64 Encoding

Base64 encoding allows any binary data to be safely represented using only 
printable ASCII characters. It is commonly used to encode e-mail attachments 
for safe transmission over SMTP. It is also used to encode user credentials in 
basic HTTP authentication.

Base64 encoding processes input data in blocks of three bytes. Each of these 
blocks is divided into four chunks of six bits each. Six bits of data allows for 64 
different possible permutations, so each chunk can be represented using a set 
of 64 characters. Base64 encoding employs the following character set, which 
contains only printable ASCII characters:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/

If the ﬁ nal block of input data results in fewer than three chunks of output 

data, the output is padded with one or two = characters.

For example, here is the Base64-encoded form of The Web Application Hacker’s

Handbook:

VGhlIFdlYiBBcHBsaWNhdGlvbiBIYWNrZXIncyBIYW5kYm9vaw==

Many web applications use Base64 encoding to transmit binary data within 
cookies and other parameters, and even to obfuscate (that is, to hide) sensitive 
data to prevent trivial modiﬁ cation. You should always look out for, and decode, 
any Base64 data that is issued to the client. Base64-encoded strings can often 
be easily recognized by their speciﬁ c character set and the presence of padding 
characters at the end of the string.

Hex Encoding

Many applications use straightforward hexadecimal encoding when transmit-
ting binary data, using ASCII characters to represent the hexadecimal block. 
For example, hex-encoding the username “daf” within a cookie would result 
in this:

Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies

As with Base64, hex-encoded data is usually easy to spot. You should always 
attempt to decode any such data that the server sends to the client to understand 
its function.

Remoting and Serialization Frameworks

In recent years, various frameworks have evolved for creating user interfaces in 
which client-side code can remotely access various programmatic APIs imple-
mented on the server side. This allows developers to partly abstract away from 
the distributed nature of web applications and write code in a manner that is 
closer to the paradigm of a conventional desktop application. These frameworks 
typically provide stub APIs for use on the client side. They also automatically 
handle both the remoting of these API calls to the relevant server-side functions 
and the serialization of any data that is passed to those functions.

Examples of these kinds of remoting and serialization frameworks include 

the following:

 n Flex and AMF

 n Silverlight and WCF

 n Java serialized objects

Next Steps

We will discuss techniques for working with these frameworks, and the kinds 

of security issues that can arise, in Chapters 4 and 5.

So far, we have described the current state of web application (in)security, exam-
ined the core mechanisms by which web applications can defend themselves, 
and taken a brief look at the key technologies employed in today’s applications. 
With this groundwork in place, we are now in a position to start looking at the 
actual practicalities of attacking web applications.

In any attack, your ﬁ rst task is to map the target application’s content and 
functionality to establish how it functions, how it attempts to defend itself, and 
what technologies it uses. The next chapter examines this mapping process 
in detail and shows how you can use it to obtain a deep understanding of an 
application’s attack surface. This knowledge will prove vital when it comes to 
ﬁ nding and exploiting security ﬂ aws within your target.
